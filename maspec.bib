abstract = {Consequences of species-area relationships (SARs) of the form S = cA(z) are derived; One consequence is an endemics-area relationship (EAR); it is of the same power-law form as the SAR but with an exponent z' that is a function only of z and that always exceeds unity. An explicit formula is derived for the dependence of species turnover in space on census plot size, interplot distance, and the SAR exponent z; this formula can be used to determine z over spatial scales that are too large to permit direct estimate of z by censusing of nested patches. The areal dependence of link-species patterns observed in food webs is also examined; SARs are shown to imply the approximate, but not exact, area-independence of link-species relationships of the form L = kS(y), where L is the number-of trophic links and y less than or equal to 2. A relationship between the average range of species in a habitat patch and the exponent z is also derived, leading to the result that average range is a decreasing function of both patch area and z.},

abstract = {Over the last years, fractal and multifractal geometries were applied extensively in many medical signal (1D, 2D or 3D) analysis applications like pattern recognition, texture analysis and segmentation. Application of this geometry relies heavily on the estimation of the fractal features. Various methods were proposed to estimate the fractal dimension or multifractal spectral of a signal. This article presents an overview of these algorithms, the way they work, their benefits and their limits. The aim of this review is to explain and to categorize the various algorithms into groups and their application in the field of medical signal analysis.},

These display three distinct phases with the central phase being well approximated by a "power law" where species richness \{(S)\} is related to area \{(A)\} by S = \{cA(z).\} If seeds are normally distributed in space about their parent, the power law phase of the \{SAC\} is unrealistically narrow, and implausibly large speciation rates are required to fit empirical data. However, if dispersal follows a more realistic "fat-tailed" distribution (where long-distance dispersal events are more likely) the \{SACs\} fit the empirical data better, have a power law that holds for a much broader range of areas, and require a dramatically smaller speciation rate than when dispersal is normally distributed. Neutral models with biologically plausible dispersal parameters and speciation rates lead to empirically realistic \{SACs.\}},

abstract = {Understanding of spatial pattern and scale has been identified as a key issue in ecology, yet ecology has traditionally lacked necessary tools for making inference about relationships between scale-specific patterns. We introduce wavelet-coefficient regression, in which the dependent and independent variables are wavelet transformed prior to analysis, as a means to formalize scale-specific relationships in ecological data. We apply this method to data on vegetation and environmental factors related to water availability from Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park (California, USA). We find that the wavelet transform and wavelet-coefficient regression efficiently characterize scale-specific pattern in these data. We also find that different environmental factors show up as good predictors of vegetation growth at different scales and that these differences in scale greatly facilitate interpretation of the mechanisms relating water availability to vegetation growth.},

abstract = {We obtained spatially extensive canopy height measurements using airborne remote sensing to characterize the structure and dynamics of a tropical rain forest landscape. Light detection and ranging \{(LiDAR)\} is a remote-sensing technology that acquires measurements of canopy height and ground elevation. By recording the return time of laser pulses emitted by aircraft-mounted sensors, \{LiDAR\} systems quantify the structure and geometry of individual trees and canopy height and enable estimation of the vertical and horizontal distribution of biomass using millions of accurate height measurements. This data set contains 127 849 839 records from 128 square kilometers of tropical wet forest in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica (mean sampling density is 1.99 observations/m2). The study area includes all 16 square kilometers of mixed-land-use forest at the La Selva Biological Station and the lower flanks of Braulio Carrillo National Park. It contains a mosaic of historical and contemporary land use that is representative of contemporary tropical forest landscapes. Field studies demonstrated that \{LiDAR\} measurements were precise and accurate throughout the topographic and structural conditions at the site. Each record includes: easting and northing mapped coordinates \{(UTM\} Zone 16 North), height above ground (m), interpolated ground elevation (m), and six remote-sensing descriptors (point classification, the return number, the number of returns for the given pulse, intensity, scan angle, and the time of emission of the laser pulse). The data can be applied to a wide range of questions in basic and applied science, and are a valuable resource from a well-studied tropical rain forest for teaching and education. They also provide a quantitative baseline against which future conditions can be assessed.},

abstract = {* 1This article reviews the application of some summary statistics from current theory of spatial point processes for extracting information from spatial patterns of plants. Theoretical measures and issues connected with their estimation are described. Results are illustrated in the context of specific ecological questions about spatial patterns of trees in two forests. * 2The pair correlation function, related to Ripley's K function, provides a formal measure of the density of neighbouring plants and makes precise the general notion of a âplant's-eyeâ view of a community. The pair correlation function can also be used to describe spatial relationships of neighbouring plants with different qualitative properties, such as species identity and size class. * 3The mark correlation function can be used to describe the spatial relationships of quantitative measures (e.g. biomass). We discuss two types of correlation function for quantitative marks. Applying these functions to the distribution of biomass in a temperate forest, it is shown that the spatial pattern of biomass is uncoupled from the spatial pattern of plant locations. * 4The inhomogeneous pair correlation function enables first-order heterogeneity in the environment to be removed from second-order spatial statistics. We illustrate this for a tree species in a forest of high topographic heterogeneity and show that spatial aggregation remains after allowing for spatial variation in density. An alternative method, the master function, takes a weighted average of homogeneous pair correlation functions computed in subareas; when applied to the same data and compared with the former method, the spatial aggregations are smaller in size. * 5Synthesis. These spatial statistics, especially those derived from pair densities, will help ecologists to extract important ecological information from intricate spatially correlated plants in populations and communities.},

abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity is considered to be one of the main factors associated with biodiversity given that areas with highly heterogeneous environments can host more species due to their higher number of available niches. In this view, spatial variability extracted from remotely sensed images has been used as a proxy of species diversity, as these data provide an inexpensive means of deriving environmental information for large areas in a consistent and regular manner. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the state of the art in the use of spectral heterogeneity for estimating species diversity. We will examine a number of issues related to this theme, dealing with: i) the main sensors used for biodiversity monitoring, ii) scale matching problems between remotely sensed and field diversity data, iii) spectral heterogeneity measurement techniques, iv) types of species taxonomic diversity measures and how they influence the relationship between spectral and species diversity, v) spectral versus genetic diversity, and vi) modeling procedures for relating spectral and species diversity. Our review suggests that remotely sensed spectral heterogeneity information provides a crucial baseline for rapid estimation or prediction of biodiversity attributes and hotspots in space and time.},

@article{Saravia2012a,
abstract = {Periphyton is an aquatic community composed by algae, bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms that can develop a complex architecture comparable to tropical forests. We analyzed the spatial pattern of a periphyton community along a succession developed in experimental tanks. Our aim was to identify regularities that may help us to explain the patchiness of this community. Therefore, we estimated the spatial pattern of periphyton biomass using a non-destructive image analysis technique to obtain a temporal series of the spatial distribution. These were analyzed using multifractal techniques. Multifractals are analogous to fractals but they look at the geometry of quantities instead of the geometry of pattern. To use these techniques the object of study must show scale invariance and then can be characterized by a spectra of fractal dimensions. Selforganization describes the evolution of complex structures that emerge spontaneously driven internally by variations of the system itself. The spatial distribution of biomass showed scale invariance at all stages of succession and as the periphyton developed in a homogeneous landscape, in a demonstration of self-organized behavior. Self-organization to a critical state (SOC) is presented in the complex systems literature as a general explanation for scale invariance in nature. SOC requires a mechanism where the history of past events in a place influence the actual dynamics, this was termed ecological memory. The scale invariance was found from the very beginning of the succession thus selforganized criticality is a very improbable explanation for the pattern because there would be not enough time for the build up of ecological memory. Positive interactions between algae and bacteria, and the existence of different spatial scales of colonization and growth are the likely causes of this pattern. Our work is a demonstration of how large scale patterns emerge from local biotic interactions.},

Neutral theory proposes that the niche concept may not be needed to explain the assemblage and diversity of natural communities, challenging the classical view of community ecology and generating a lasting debate. Biological invasions, when considered as natural experiments, can be used to contrast some of the predictions of neutral and classic niche \{theories.Location\} \{Global.Methods\} We use data from biological invasions as natural experiments to contrast some of the fundamental predictions of neutral \{theory.Results\} Some emerging patterns did not differ from neutral model expectations (e.g. the relationship between native and exotic species richness, invasibility of resource-rich habitats, and the relationship between propagule release and invasion success). Nevertheless, other patterns (e.g. experimental evidence of the relationship between diversity and susceptibility to invasion, the invasion of communities with a low resource availability, invasiveness related to species traits) contrasted with the predictions that can be inferred from neutral \{theory.Main\} conclusions Neutral theory correctly highlights the need to include randomness in models of community structure. Biological invasion patterns show that neutral forces are important in structuring natural communities, but the patterns differ from those inferred from a complete neutral model. For biodiversity-conservation purposes, the implications of accepting or not accepting neutral theory as a process-based theory are very important.},

Microalgal biofilms (periphyton) were exposed to different mixtures of two benthic herbivores, the isopod Idothea chelipes and the gastropod Littorina littorea. The herbivores are similar in their feeding selectivity but differ strongly in the spatial pattern of grazing. Idothea did not increase the spatial heterogeneity of algal cell densities beyond the level of ungrazed controls (<1 order of magnitude between local minima and maxima at the 1 mm 2 scale). Littorina grazing, in contrast, created a pronounced spatial heterogeneity with maximum: minmum ratios of almost 3 orders of magnitude. When algae were exposed to mixtures of both gazers, the spatial heterogeneity of microalgal cell densities increased with an increasing proportion of Littorina in the herbivore mixture. Algal species richness, diversity and evenness also increased with increasing proportions of Littorina, and was highly significantly correlated with the spatial heterogeneity of cell densities.},

@article{Tuomisto2012,
abstract = {Ecologists widely agree that species diversity consists of two components, richness (the number of species) and evenness (a measure of the equitability of the proportional abundances of those species). However, no consensus on an exact definition of evenness (or equitability) has emerged. Instead, numerous equitability indices have been used in the ecological literature, as different researchers have preferred indices with different mathematical properties. In this paper, I show that the phrase âspecies diversity consists of two independent components, richness and evennessâ logically leads to one particular definition of evenness (Evenness = Diversity/Richness). To facilitate accurate communication, I propose that the term âevennessâ be used only to refer to this phenomenon, and that other terms be used for the equitability indices that measure other things. Here I provide a review of popular equitability indices, explain what each measures in practice, and show how they relate to each other and to evenness itself. I also explore how the partitioning of diversity into richness and evenness components is related to the partitioning of diversity into alpha and beta components. Dissecting the indices makes it easier to see the conceptual differences among them. Such understanding is necessary to ensure that an appropriate index is chosen for the questions at hand, as well as to interpret the index values correctly and to assess when index values can and when they cannot be considered comparable.},

The first section provides introductory material and different definitions of a multifractal measure. The author then examines some of the various constructions for describing multifractal measures. Building from the theory of large deviations, he focuses on constructions based on lattice coverings, covering by point-centered spheres, and cascades processes. The final section presents estimators of Renyi dimensions of integer order two and greater and discusses their properties. It also explores various applications of dimension estimation and provides a detailed case study of spatial point patterns of earthquake locations. Estimating fractal dimensions holds particular value in studies of nonlinear dynamical systems, time series, and spatial point patterns.

As a consequence, there may be a weak or no predictive relationship between the mean of the response variable (y) distribution and the measured predictive factors (X). Yet there may be stronger, useful predictive relationships with other parts of the response variable distribution.

In this article, we apply multifractals to the species-area relationship and species abundance distributions. We highlight two results: first, species abundance distributions collected at different spatial scales may collapse into a single curve after appropriate renormalization, and second, the power-law form of the species-area relationship and the Shannon, Simpson, and Berger-Parker diversity indices belong to a family of equations relating the species number, species abundance, and area through the moments of the species abundanceâprobability density function. Explicit formulas for these diversity indices, as a function of area, are derived. Methods to obtain the multifractal spectra from a data set are discussed, and an example is shown with data on tree and shrub species collected in a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama.

abstract = {Landscape pattern indices (LPI), which characterize various aspects of composition and configuration of categorical variables on a lattice (e.g., shape, clumping, proportion), have become increasingly popular for quantifying and characterizing various aspects of spatial patterns. Unlike in the case of spatial statistical models, when either the joint distribution of all values is characterized by a limited number of parameters, or the distribution is known for certain (usually random) cases, the distributions of LPI are not known. Therefore, comparisons of LPI or significance testing of differences among various landscapes and/or studies are uncertain. This paper scrutinizes six widely used LPI, which are computed based on categories mapped onto regular lattices. We designed a simulation using Gauss-Markov random fields to establish the empirical distributions of LPI as functions of landscape composition and configuration. We report the results for stationary binary landscapes. The confidence intervals for LPI are derived based on 1000 simulations of each given combination of parameters, and further details are evaluated for three illustrative cases. We report the distributions of the LPI along with their co-variation. Our results elucidate how proportion of cover classes and spatial autocorrelation simultaneously and significantly affect the outcome of LPI values. These results also highlight the importance and formal linkages between fully specified spatial stochastic models and spatial pattern analysis. We conclude that LPI must be compared with great care because of the drastic effects that both composition and configuration have on individual LPI values. We also stress the importance of knowing the expected range of variation about LPI values so that statistical comparisons and inferences can be made.},

abstract = {Understanding factors that shape biodiversity and species coexistence across scales is of utmost importance in ecology, both theoretically and for conservation policies. Species-area relationships (SARs), measuring how the number of observed species increases upon enlarging the sampled area, constitute a convenient tool for quantifying the spatial structure of biodiversity. While general features of species-area curves are quite universal across ecosystems, some quantitative aspects can change significantly. Several attempts have been made to link these variations to ecological forces. Within the framework of spatially explicit neutral models, here we scrutinize the effect of varying the local population size (i.e. the number of individuals per site) and the level of habitat saturation (allowing for empty sites). We conclude that species-area curves become shallower when the local population size increases, while habitat saturation, unless strongly violated, plays a marginal role. Our findings provide a plausible explanation of why SARs for microorganisms are flatter than those for larger organisms.},

abstract = {To use fractal models for ecological and geologic data, the statistical properties of fractals need to be clarified. No sampling or estimation theory for fractals currently exists. Several concrete steps in this direction are taken here. First, the information fractal dimension is proposed as a new measure that is relatively robust with respect to sampling error and can handle intensive data. The information fractal is tested with field data and is shown to be capable of delineating stratified structures and defining the scale of heterogeneity in the data. Comparison to semivariance analysis reveals the superiority of the fractal model for sample data that are nonisotropic and nonstationary. It is argued that approaches using regression to estimate fractal dimensions of spatial patterns are statistically invalid, and alternatives are proposed. Sampling of natural objects with transects (e.g., wells) is explored. For nonisotropic media (or maps), random placement of transects is shown to give an unreliable estimate of pattern. For transects taken perpendicular to a directional pattern (i.e., strata), it is shown that the mean of multiple estimates of the multiscale fractal dimensional profile does converge to the true value. Other sampling issues are addressed.},

abstract = {The intuitive notion that a healthy organism is characterised by regular, mechanistic function has been challenged by observations that a loss complexity is, in fact, indicative of ill-health. Monofractals succinctly describe complex processes, and are controlled by a single time-invariant scaling exponent, H, simply related to the fractal dimension. A previous analysis of resting \{fMRI\} time-series demonstrated that ageing and scopolamine administration were both associated with increases in H and that faster response in a prior encoding task was also associated with increased H. We revisit this experiment with a novel regional, multifractal approach in which fractal dynamics are assumed non-stationary and defined by a spectrum of local singularity exponents. Parameterisation of this spectrum was capable of refracting the effects of age, scopolamine and task performance as well as a refining a description of the associated signal changes. Using the same imaging data, we also explored turbulence as a possible mechanism underlying multifractal dynamics. Evidence is provided that Carstaingâs model of turbulent information flow from high to low scales has only limited validity, and that invariance of energy dissipation is better explained by critical-phase phenomena, supporting the proposition that the brain maintains a state of self-organised criticality.},

abstract = {Identifying scales of pattern in ecological systems and coupling patterns to processes that create them are ongoing challenges. We examined the utility of three techniques (lacunarity, spectral, and wavelet analysis) for detecting scales of pattern of ecological data. We compared the information obtained using these methods for four datasets, including: surface temperature across space (linear transect), surface temperature across time, understory plant diversity across space (linear transect), and a simulated series of known structure. For temperature and plant diversity across the transect, we expected to find dominant scales of pattern of approximately 220\&\#xa0;m and, for plant diversity scales of pattern of \&gt;450\&\#xa0;m, corresponding to management activities on the study landscapes. For temperature across time, we predicted a dominant scale of 24\&\#xa0;h. The simulated data included a sine wave with a known period of 9.9 units, an edge at approximately 30 units, and a random component. The different analyses provided unique but complementary information. Lacunarity and spectral analyses were most consistent with each other across datasets, both indicating a dominant scale of pattern at 400â500\&\#xa0;m (coarser than expected) for the transect temperature series, a lack of dominant scale in the pattern of understory diversity, and scales of pattern at 1.8â5.1 and 8.5â11.1 units (âwavelength) for the simulated data series. Spectral analysis best approximated an expected, 24\&\#xa0;h period in the temporal temperature series. Wavelet variance detected finer scales of pattern (240\&\#xa0;m) in transect temperature and suggested patterns in plant diversity at scales of 460 and 1100\&\#xa0;m. By retaining locational information, only the wavelet transform and associated position variance detected the abrupt edge in the simulated data series. Wavelet analysis also emphasized variability, even within cyclic phenomena, not identified by spectral or lacunarity analyses, and suggested hierarchical structure in the pattern of understory plant diversity. The appropriate technique for assessing scales of pattern depends on the type of data available, the question being asked, and the detail of information desired. This comparison highlighted the importance of: (1) using multiple techniques to examine scales of pattern in ecological data; (2) interpreting analysis results in concert with examination and ecological knowledge of the original data; and (3) utilizing results to direct subsequent descriptive and experimental examination of features or processes inducing scales of pattern.},

abstract = {We report a novel pattern in species richness, complementary to the well-known speciesâarea relationship. We show that, as sample area increases, the variation in relative richness decreases among otherwise comparable spatial units. This pattern holds for southern African birds, French birds, Cape Proteaceae and the trees of Barro Colorado Island.We propose a scale-free method for quantifying this pattern by measuring the multifractal intensity of species richness, which is the multi-scale tendency of adjacent patches with the same area to differ in richness. By this measure, spatial variability is strongest for Cape Proteaceae and weakest for Barro Colorado Island trees.Our results have implications for area-dependent estimates of species-richness, for example in reserve planning and in simulation-based studies. They imply that such estimates are most accurate for large areas, and will be subject to substantial uncertainty when the multifractal intensity is high and the area is small. For comparative purposes, multifractal intensity may be used as a supplement or as an alternative to mean richness, as well as for other ecological densities, such as biomass distribution and local abundance.},

abstract = {The ecological processes that create spatial patterns have been examined by direct measurement and through measurement of patterns resulting from experimental manipulations. But in many situations, creating experiments and direct measurement of spatial processes can be difficult or impossible. Here, we identify and define a rapidly emerging alternative approach, which we formalize as âspace as a surrogateâ for unmeasured processes, that is used to maximize inference about ecological processes through the analysis of spatial patterns or spatial residuals alone. This approach requires three elements to be successful: a priori hypotheses, ecological theory and/or knowledge, and precise spatial analysis. We offer new insights into a long-standing debate about processâpattern links in ecology and highlight six recent studies that have successfully examined spatial patterns to understand a diverse array of processes: competition in forest-stand dynamics, dispersal of freshwater fish, movement of American marten, invasion mechanisms of exotic trees, dynamics of natural disturbances, and tropical-plant diversity. Key benefits of using space as a surrogate can be found where experimental manipulation or direct measurements are difficult or expensive to obtain or not possible. We note that, even where experiments can be performed, this procedure may aid in measuring the in situ importance of the processes uncovered through experiments.},

abstract = {There is increased interest in vegetation spatial pattern as an indicator of transition shifts following catastrophes. Much, however, remains unknown about the mechanisms that underlie spatial pattern formations. In this study, we examined how the spatial heterogeneity of species distributions in the grasslands of the Central Pyrenees and Middle Atlas Mountains is associated with plant species diversity and the importance of self-organizing processes in the control of pattern formations. In the grasslands of the Central Pyrenees and Middle Atlas, the spatial heterogeneity of species distributions increased along a habitat degradation gradient defined by an increase in bare soil. In Central Pyrenees grasslands, however, the increase in heterogeneity was associated with self-organizing bare soil formations, rather than the self-organizing distribution of plant species. In Middle Atlas grasslands, the increased heterogeneity of species spatial distributions was a consequence of the self-organizing capacity of the composing species; the increase in bare soil was randomly distributed. In the more heavily grazed grasslands (Middle Atlas), but not in the more lightly grazed and better preserved ecosystem (Central Pyrenees), plant species richness and diversity declined significantly with an increase in grazing pressure because fewer species were able to colonize empty space. On the contrary, the colonization of bare soil by new species increased the diversity and spatial organization of new colonizing species in Central Pyrenees grassland. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. Species in plant communities generally shown an aggregated distribution at one or more spatial scales. This, and the fact that competition between sessile organisms occurs chiefly between neighbours, suggests that the spatial configuration of plants should affect the process and outcome of interspecific competition. 2. Cellular automaton models were constructed to simulate the competitive interaction of five grass species, Agrostis stolonifera, Holcus lanatus, Cynosurus cristatus, Poa trivialis and Lolium perenne, based on experimentally determined rates of invasion. 3. A model with a random initial starting arrangement showed a very rapid loss of species compared to initial arrangements in which species occurred in monospecific bands. 4. Different arrangements of monospecific bands produced quite different results from each other, depending only upon the initial juxtaposition of species in the model community. Non-linear dynamics, with transitory increases followed by decreases in species' abundance, were observed with some starting arrangements. Community change followed trajectories that could not be deduced in any simple manner from a knowledge of pairwise interactions alone. These results suggest that the spatial pattern and configuration of competing species may be just as important as the density and frequency of competitors in determining the outcome.},

An elevational gradient in a warm temperate zone of the Donglingshan mountains (China) is used to test the scaling laws of species abundance distribution using multifractal analysis. We show that the power law scaling relationship holds for not just the classical SAR (speciesâarea relationship for richness), but also for Shannon and Simpson diversity. In fact, we find power-laws in the generalized species abundance distribution at all stratal levels of the forest (trees, shrubs and herbs). The fact that these laws exist across a heterogeneous landscape representing a strong bioclimatic gradient suggests that biodiversity scaling laws may be more robust than previously thought.},

@article{Wiegand2004e,
abstract = {A large number of methods for the analysis of point pattern data have been developed in a wide range of scientific fields. First-order statistics describe large-scale variation in the intensity of points in a study region, whereas second-order characteristics are summary statistics of all point-to-point distances in a mapped area and offer the potential for detecting both different types and scales of patterns. Second-order analysis based on Ripley's K-function is increasingly used in ecology to characterize spatial patterns and to develop hypothesis on underlying processes; however, the full range of available methods has seldomly been applied by ecologists. The aim of this paper is to provide guidance to ecologists with limited experience in second-order analysis to help in the choice of appropriate methods and to point to practical difficulties and pitfalls. We review (1) methods for analytical and numerical implementation of two complementary second-order statistics, Ripley's K and the O-ring statistic, (2) methods for edge correction, (3) methods to account for first-order effects (i.e. heterogeneity) of univariate patterns, and (4) a variety of useful standard and non-standard null models for univariate and bivariate patterns. For illustrative purpose, we analyze examples that deal with non-homogeneous univariate point patterns. We demonstrate that large-scale heterogeneity of a point-pattern biases Ripley's K-function at smaller scales. This bias is difficult to detect without explicitly testing for homogeneity, but we show that it can be removed when applying methods that account for first-order effects. We synthesize our review in a number of step-by-step recommendations that guide the reader through the selection of appropriate methods and we provide a software program that implements most of the methods reviewed and developed here.},

abstract = {Interactivity is a central theme of ecological psychology. According to Gibsonian views, behavior is the emergent property of interactions between organism and environment. Hence, an important challenge for ecological psychology has been to identify physical principles that provide an empirical window into interactivity. We suspect that multifractality, a concept from statistical physics, may be helpful in this regard, and we offer this article as a tutorial on multifractality with 2 main goals. First, we aim to describe multifractality with a series of simple, concrete, but progressively more elaborate examples that will incrementally elucidate the relationship between multifractality and interactivity. Second, we aim to describe a direct estimation method for computing the multifractal spectrum (e.g., Chhabra \& Jensen, 1989), presenting it as an alternative that avoids the pitfalls of more popular methods and that may address more appropriately the measurements traditionally taken by ecological psychologists. In sum, this tutorial aims to unpack the theoretical background for an analytical method allowing rigorous test of interactivity in a variety of empirical settings.},

The two parameters of the model are p 1 , the proportion of species that occur in the richer half, and p 2 , the proportion of species that occur in the poorer half. An equivalent parameterisation is a = ( p 1 + p 2 ) / 2 and b = p 2 / p 1 . These parameters are interpreted as follows: a gives the scaling of mean richness, b gives the scaling of spatial variation around that mean.

We aimed to disentangle the effect of species interactions (secondâorder effects) and environment (firstâorder effects) on the speciesâ spatial distributions. To characterize firstâorder associations (segregation, overlap), we developed a classification scheme based on Ripleyâs K and nearestâneighbor statistics.

Firstâorder effects were strong; overall, 53\% of all species pairs occupied largely disjoint areas (segregation), 40\% showed partial overlap, and 6\% overlapped. Only 5\% of all species pairs showed significant secondâorder effects, but about half of the species showed significant intraspecific effects. Significant plantâplant interactions occurred mostly within 2â4 m and disappeared within 15â20 m of the focal plant. While lack of significant species interactions suggests support for the unified neutral theory, speciesâ observed spatial segregation does not support the assumptions of the neutral theory. The strong observed tendency of species to segregate may have supplementary effects on other processes promoting species coexistence.},

Here, we empirically test the space-for-time assumption by constructing orthogonal datasets of compositional turnover of plant taxa and climatic dissimilarity through time and across space from Late Quaternary pollen records in eastern North America, then modeling climate-driven compositional turnover. Predictions relying on space-for-time substitution were â¼72\% as accurate as âtime-for-timeâ predictions. However, space-for-time substitution performed poorly during the Holocene when temporal variation in climate was small relative to spatial variation and required subsampling to match the extent of spatial and temporal climatic gradients.

abstract = {Abstract The spatial structure of neutral communities has nontrivial properties, which are described traditionally by the Species-Area relationship (\{SAR)\} and the Species Abundance Distribution, (\{SAD).\} Fractal analysis is an alternative way to describe community structure, the final product of which â a multifractal spectrum â combines information both on the scaling parameters of species richness (similar to \{SAR)\}, and about species' relative abundances (similar to \{SAD).\} We conducted a multifractal analysis of community spatial structure in a neutral lattice-based model. In a realistic range of dispersal distances, moments of the species abundance distribution form a family of curves of the same shape, which are reduced to a single universal curve through a scaling collapse procedure. Trivial scaling is observed on small and large scales, which reflects homogeneity of species distribution at small scales and a limiting log-series distribution at large scales. Multifractal spectra for different speciation rates and dispersal kernels are obtained for the intermediate region of scaling. Analysis of spectra reveals that the key model parameters determine not only the species richness and its scaling, but also of species dominance and rarity. We discovered a phenomenon of negative dimensions in the multifractal spectrum. Negative dimensions have no direct interpretation from a purely physical point of view, but have biological meaning because they reflect the negative relationship between the number of singletons and the area.},

abstract = {Dispersal is a key mechanism to help populations propagate across space and thus is important in helping to understand spatial patterns. However, it is often difficult to quantify empirically as it requires intensive and detailed field study. Here we describe a method for estimating the effective dispersal distance of tropical plant populations. The method integrates a simple spatially explicit, individual-based dynamic model and spatial statistical analysis. The model is partly parameterized from spatial point pattern data as well as time series data from a 50 ha tropical forest plot in Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in Panama. Correlation between our estimated dispersal distances and those from inverse modeling based on field studies to date on BCI raises some questions about the match between our methods and those previously used. The method we propose can be generalized to any population for which spatial point pattern data are available. Additional field studies would be useful to further validate our method.},

Our model includes variable dispersal distances and exhibits qualitatively different behaviour from the cases of nearest-neighbour dispersal and finite periodic landscapes that have previously been studied. We show that different dispersal distances and even different dispersal kernels produce identical speciesâarea curves up to rescaling of the two axes. This scaling property provides a straightforward method for fitting the model to empirical data. The speciesâarea curves display all three phases observed empirically and enable the exponent describing the power law relationship for speciesâarea curves to be identified as the gradient at the central phase. This exponent can take all values between 0 and 1 and is given by a simple function of the speciation rate, independent of all other model variables.},

We explore what this concept of equivalence means in ecological communities, how such species may arise evolutionarily, and how the possibility of ecological equivalents relates to previous ideas about niche differentiation. We also show that the co-occurrence of ecologically similar or equivalent species is not incompatible with niche theory as has been supposed, because niche relations can sometimes favor coexistence of similar species. We argue that both evolutionary and ecological processes operate to promote the introduction and to sustain the persistence of ecologically similar and in many cases nearly equivalent species embedded in highly structured food webs. Future work should focus on synthesizing niche and neutral perspectives rather than dichotomously debating whether neutral or niche models provide better explanations for community structure and biodiversity.},

abstract = {Self-organized spatial patterns have been proposed as possible indicators for regime shifts in ecosystems. Until now, this hypothesis has only been tested in drylands. Here, we focus on intertidal mudflats where regular spatial patterns develop in early spring from the interaction between diatom growth and sedimentation but disappear when benthic herbivore abundance increases in early summer, accompanied by a dramatic shift to a bare mudflat. We followed the patch-size distributions of diatom biofilms during this degradation process. As time progressed, we found a temporal change in the spatial configuration occurring simultaneously with the loss of the diatomâsediment feedback. This indicates a gradual failure in time of the self-organization process that underlies regular patterning in this ecosystem. The path to degradation co-occurred with the loss of the larger patches in the ecosystem, which resulted in a decrease of the truncation in the patch-size distribution. Hence, our study in mudflat ecosystems confirms the general hypothesis that spatial patterns can provide important clues about the level of degradation. Nevertheless, our study highlights the need for thorough study about the type of spatial patterns and the nature of the underlying feedbacks before a reliable assessment of ecosystem status can be made, as changes in patch-size distribution differed markedly with those observed in other ecosystems.},

In the box-counting applications the influence of the mesh number was investigated in the range 20 to 100, for moment orders from 0 to 10, showing that the error in the assessment of the generalized fractal dimensions is not greater than 3\%. The sandbox method was applied to the river networks for the first time, and the theoretical expression of the information entropy was derived. Results were obtained also for negative moment orders, showing that the analyzed river networks are multifractal and non-plane-filling structures. The sandbox method avoids border effects, as verified through an application to a square portion extracted from a river network. Result analysis suggests a dependence of the f($\alpha$) spectra from the lithologic characteristics of the source rocks.},

Even moderate habitat destruction is predicted to cause time-delayed but deterministic extinction of the dominant competitor in remnant patches. Further species are predicted to become extinct, in order from the best to the poorest competitors, as habitat destruction increases. More-over, the more fragmented a habitat already is, the greater is the number of extinctions caused by added destruction.

In ecology, biology, and many physical and social sciences, the exponents of these power laws are estimated to draw inference about the processes underlying the phenomenon, to test theoretical models, and to scale up from local observations to global patterns. Therefore, it is essential that these exponents be estimated accurately. Unfortunately, the binning-based methods traditionally used in ecology and other disciplines perform quite poorly. Here we discuss more sophisticated methods for fitting these exponents based on cumulative distribution functions and maximum likelihood estimation. We illustrate their superior performance at estimating known exponents and provide details on how and when ecologists should use them. Our results confirm that maximum likelihood estimation outperforms other methods in both accuracy and precision. Because of the use of biased statistical methods for estimating the exponent, the conclusions of several recently published papers should be revisited.},

However, this relationship between dispersal distance and seed mass has only been quantified for species from particular sites or with particular dispersal syndromes.2. We provided the first large-scale, cross-species quantification of the correlations between dispersal distance and both seed mass and plant height. Seed mass was positively related to mean dispersal distance, with a 100-fold increase in seed mass being associated with a 4.5-fold increase in mean dispersal distance \{(R2\} = 0.16; n = 210 species; P \{$\backslash$textless\} 0.001). However, plant height had substantially stronger explanatory power than did seed mass, and we found a 5-fold increase in height was associated with a 4.6-fold increase in mean dispersal distance \{(R2\} = 0.54; n = 211 species; P \{$\backslash$textless\} 0.001).3. Once plant height was accounted for, we found that small-seeded species dispersed further than did large-seeded species \{(R2\} = 0.54; n = 181 species; slope = â0.130; P \{$\backslash$textless\} 0.001); however, seed mass only added 2\% to the R2 of the model. Within dispersal syndromes, tall species dispersed further than did short species, while seed mass had little influence on dispersal distance.4. Synthesis. These findings enhance our understanding of plant life-history strategies and improve our ability to predict which species are best at colonizing new environments.},

@article{Lennon2000,
abstract = {I draw attention to the need for ecologists to take spatial structure into account more seriously in hypothesis testing. If spatial autocorrelation is ignored, as it usually is, then analyses of ecological patterns in terms of environmental factors can produce very misleading results. This is demonstrated using synthetic but realistic spatial patterns with known spatial properties which are subjected to classical correlation and multiple regression analyses. Correlation between an autocorrelated response variable and each of a set of explanatory variables is strongly biased in favour of those explanatory variables that are highly autocorrelated - the expected magnitude of the correlation coefficient increases with autocorrelation even if the spatial patterns are completely independent. Similarly, multiple regression analysis finds highly autocorrelated explanatory variables âsignificantâ much more frequently than it should. The chances of mistakenly identifying a âsignificantâ slope across an autocorrelated pattern is very high if classical regression is used. Consequently, under these circumstances strongly autocorrelated environmental factors reported in the literature as associated with ecological patterns may not actually be significant. It is likely that these factors wrongly described as important constitute a red-shifted subset of the set of potential explanations, and that more spatially discontinuous factors (those with bluer spectra) are actually relatively more important than their present status suggests. There is much that ecologists can do to improve on this situation. I discuss various approaches to the problem of spatial autocorrelation from the literature and present a randomisation test for the association of two spatial patterns which has advantages over currently available methods.},

abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

This mapping provides a connection between patch statistics and the dynamics of the ecosystem; the âfirst passage timeâ for different colonies emerges as a powerful tool that discriminates between endogenous and exogenous clustering mechanisms.

abstract = {Tree species in tropical rain forests exhibit a rich panoply of spatial patterns that beg ecological explanation. The analysis of tropical census data typically relies on spatial statistics, which quantify the average aggregation tendency of a species. In this article we develop a cluster-based approach that complements traditional spatial statistics in the exploration and analysis of ecological hypotheses for spatial pattern. We apply this technique to six study species within a fully mapped 50-ha forest census in peninsular Malaysia. For each species we identify the scale(s) of spatial aggregation and the corresponding tree clusters. We study the correlation between cluster locations and abiotic variables such as topography. We find that the distribution of cluster sizes exhibits equilibrium and nonequilibrium behavior depending on species life history. The distribution of tree diameters within clusters also varies according to species life history. At different spatial scales, we find evidence for both niche-based and dispersal-limited processes producing spatial pattern. Our methodology for identifying scales of aggregation and clusters is general; we discuss the method's applicability to spatial problems outside of tropical plant ecology.},

We present quantitative estimates of beta-diversity for tropical trees by comparing species composition of plots in lowland terra firme forest in Panama, Ecuador, and Peru. We compare observations with predictions derived from a neutral model in which habitat is uniform and only dispersal and speciation influence species turnover. We find that beta-diversity is higher in Panama than in western Amazonia and that patterns in both areas are inconsistent with the neutral model. In Panama, habitat variation appears to increase species turnover relative to Amazonia, where unexpectedly low turnover over great distances suggests that population densities of some species are bounded by as yet unidentified processes. At intermediate scales in both regions, observations can be matched by theory, suggesting that dispersal limitation, with speciation, influences species turnover.},

abstract = {We propose a description of normalized distributions (measures) lying upon possibly fractal sets; for example those arising in dynamical systems theory. We focus upon the scaling properties of such measures, by considering their singularities, which are characterized by two indices: alpha , which determines the strength of their singularities; and f, which describes how densely they are distributed. The spectrum of singularities is described by giving the possible range of alpha values and the function f( alpha ). We apply this formalism to the 2 [infinity] cycle of period doubling, to the devil's staircase of mode locking, and to trajectories on 2-tori with golden-mean winding numbers. In all cases the new formalism allows an introduction of smooth functions to characterize the measures. We believe that this formalism is readily applicable to experiments and should result in new tests of global universality.},

abstract = {Although spatial patterns of seed distribution are thought to vary greatly among plant species dispersed by different vectors, few studies have directly examined this assumption. We compared patterns of seed rain of nine species of trees disseminated by large birds, monkeys, and wind in a closed canopy forest in Cameroon. We used maximum-likelihood methods to fit seed rain data to four dispersal functions: inverse power, negative exponential, Gaussian, and Student t. We then tested for differences in dispersal characteristics (1) among individuals within species, and (2) among species dispersed by the same vector. In general, an inverse power function best described animal-dispersed species and the Gaussian and Student t functions best described wind-dispersed species. Animal-dispersed species had longer mean dispersal distances than wind-dispersed species, but lower fecundities. In addition to these distinct differences in average dispersal distance and functional form of the seed shadow between animal- and wind-dispersed species, seed shadows varied markedly within species and vector, with conspecifics and species within vector varying in their dispersal scale, fecundity, and clumping parameters. Dispersal vectors determine a significant amount of variation in seed distribution, but much variation remains to be explained. Finally, we demonstrate that most seeds, regardless of vector, fall directly under the parent canopy. Long-distance dispersal events (>60 m) account for a small proportion of the seed crop but may still be important in terms of the absolute numbers of dispersed seeds and effects on population and community dynamics.},

The aim of this study was threefold: first, to apply and test a common geostatistical tool (semivariograms) to disentangle competition and microsite effects; second, to assess the results of this methodology against a generalized early stand development model for tree populations; and third, to examine the role and timing of microsite and competition processes in early population stages. We mapped and measured annual relative growth rates of trees in three different-aged ponderosa pine stands in Patagonia, Chile. We tested the relative support of five a priori semivariogram-based hypotheses and showed that through stand development, many sites followed our expected sequence of semivariogram models. These translated to initial spatially random growth followed by microsite-dominated, mixed microsite and competition, and finally pure competition effects on growth. Our approach will have many and diverse applications wherever processes differ in the type of spatial pattern they exhibit as well as in spatial scale. We emphasize that this methodology works best when there is strong a priori support for the hypotheses being tested but the timing, strength, and occurrence of processes are not known.},

abstract = {1. Aquatic plants are a key component of spatial heterogeneity in a waterscape, contributing to habitat complexity and helping determine diversity at various spatial scales. Theoretically, the more complex a habitat, the higher the number of species present. 2. Few empirical data are available to test the hypothesis that complexity increases diversity in aquatic communities (e.g. Jeffries, 1993). Fractal dimension has become widely applied in ecology as a tool to quantify the degree of complexity at different scales. 3. We investigated the hypothesis that complexity in vegetated habitat in two tropical lagoons mediates littoral invertebrate number of taxa (S) and density (N). Aquatic macrophyte habitat complexity was defined using a fractal dimension and a gradient of natural plant complexities. We also considered plant area, plant identity and, only for S, invertebrate density as additional explanatory variables. 4. Our results indicate that habitat complexity provided by the different architectures of aquatic plants, significantly affects both S and total N. However, number of individuals (as a result of passive sampling) also helps to account for S and, together with plant identity and area, contributes to the determination of N. We suggest that measurements of structural complexity, measured through fractal geometry, should be included in studies aimed at explaining attributes of attached invertebrates at small (e.g. plant or leaf) scales.},

However, p for non-overlapping 95 per cent CIs is actually considerably smaller than 0.05: If the two CIs just touch, p is about 0.01, and the intervals can overlap by as much as about half the length of one CI arm before p becomes as large as 0.05. Keeping in mind this ruleï¿½-ï¿½that overlap of half the length of one arm corresponds approximately to statistical significance at p = 0.05ï¿½-ï¿½can be helpful for a quick appreciation of figures that display CIs, especially if precise p-values are not reported. The author investigated the robustness of this and similar rules, and found them sufficiently accurate when sample sizes are at least 10, and the two intervals do not differ in width by more than a factor of 2. The author reviewed previous discussions of CI overlap and extended the investigation to p-values other than 0.05 and 0.01. He also studied 95 per cent CIs on two proportions, and on two Pearson correlations, and found similar rules apply to overlap of these asymmetric CIs, for a very broad range of cases. Wider use of figures with 95 per cent CIs is desirable, and these rules may assist easy and appropriate understanding of such figures.},

We demonstrate here that the extent and scale of conspecific spatial aggregation is correlated with the mode of seed dispersal. This relationship holds for saplings as well as for mature trees. Phylogenetically independent contrasts confirm that the relationship between dispersal and spatial pattern is significant even after controlling for common ancestry among species. We found the same qualitative results for a 50-hectare tropical forest plot in Panama. Our results provide broad empirical evidence for the importance of dispersal mode in establishing the long-term community structure of tropical forests.},

abstract = {Multifractal scaling (MFS) refers to structures that can be described as a collection of interwoven fractal subsets which exhibit power-law spatial scaling behavior with a range of scaling exponents (concentration, or singularity, strengths) and dimensions. The existence of MFS implies an underlying multiplicative (or hierarchical, or cascade) process. Panoramic column density images of several nearby star-forming cloud complexes, constructed from IRAS data, are shown to exhibit such multifractal scaling, which we interpret as indirect but quantitative evidence for nested hierarchical structure. The relation between the dimensions of the subsets and their concentration strengths (the "multifractal spectrum") appears to satisfactorily order the observed regions in terms of the mixture of geometries present, from strong point-like concentrations, to line-like filaments or fronts, to space-filling diffuse structures. This multifractal spectrum is a global property of the regions studied, and does not rely on any operational definition of "clouds." The range of forms of the multifractal spectrum among the regions studied implies that the column density structures do not form a universality class, in contrast to indications for velocity and passive scalar fields in incompressible turbulence, providing another indication that the physics of highly compressible interstellar gas dynamics differs fundamentally from incompressible turbulence. There is no correlation between the geometrical properties of the regions studied and their level of internal star formation activity, a result that is also apparent from visual inspection. We discuss the viability of the multifractal spectrum as a measure of the structural "complexity" of the regions studied, and emphasize the problematic dependence of all structural descriptors on the subjective pre-selection of the region to be described. A comparison of IRAS 100 Âµm column density (not intensity) images with 13CO, visual extinction, and C18O data suggests that structural details are captured by IRAS up to at least 30 magnitudes of visual extinction, except in the vicinity of embedded stars, and that lower-column density connective structure not seen by other methods is revealed.},

abstract = {Mechanisms proposed to explain the maintenance of species diversity within ecological communities of sessile organisms include niche differentiation mediated by competitive trade-offs, frequency dependence resulting from species-specific pests, recruitment limitation due to local dispersal, and a speciation-extinction dynamic equilibrium mediated by stochasticity (drift). While each of these processes, and more, have been shown to act in particular communities, much remains to be learned about their relative importance in shaping community-level patterns. We used a spatially-explicit, individual-based model to assess the effects of each of these processes on species richness, relative abundance, and spatial patterns such as the species-area curve. Our model communities had an order-of-magnitude more individuals than any previous such study, and we also developed a finite-size scaling analysis to infer the large-scale properties of these systems in order to establish the generality of our conclusions across system sizes. As expected, each mechanism can promote diversity. We found some qualitative differences in community patterns across communities in which different combinations of these mechanisms operate. Species-area curves follow a power law with short-range dispersal and a logarithmic law with global dispersal. Relative-abundance distributions are more even for systems with competitive differences and trade-offs than for those in which all species are competitively equivalent, and they are most even when frequency dependence (even if weak) is present. Overall, however, communities in which different processes operated showed surprisingly similar patterns, which suggests that the form of community-level patterns cannot in general be used to distinguish among mechanisms maintaining diversity there. Nevertheless, parameterization of models such as these from field data on the strengths of the different mechanisms could yield insight into their relative roles in diversity maintenance in any given community.},

abstract = {Benthic diatom assemblages respond to changes in water quality, and this response is evidenced by shifts in taxonomic composition. As a result, several taxon-based indices have been developed for monitoring purposes. Some authors have suggested that diatom body size might provide a simpler method for bioassessment than taxonomy-based approaches. Moreover, current knowledge of algal ecology suggests that the slopes and intercepts of density size distributions should vary with environmental characteristics. However, results from studies of the relationship between algal size and trophic variables including P have been mixed. Our objectives were to examine normalized density size distributions and richness size distributions of benthic diatoms in streams along a gradient of agricultural land use to determine whether the size distributions changed in relation to environmental variables. Benthic diatoms from 29 streams in eastern Canada were identified and average body size measurements were obtained for each taxon. Normalized density size distributions and richness size distributions were plotted, and slopes and intercepts were compared among sites using general linear models (GLMs). Despite taxonomic differences in the assemblages, slopes of the normalized density size distributions did not differ among the 29 sites, and distribution shape and intercepts for the richness size distributions did not differ among sites. The intercepts of the normalized density size distributions were significantly different among sites, and this variation was attributed in part to the effect of several environmental variables including N and P. However, this difference in intercepts represented a change in density across all size classes, rather than a size-specific change. Environmental variables did not explain a significant amount of the variance in the shapes of density or richness size distributions. These results suggest that the slopes of lotic benthic diatom size distributions do not differ in response to environmental variables including P. Thus, benthic diatom body size should not be used as a proxy for nutrient status in environmental monitoring.},

abstract = {The composition of communities of sessile organisms, and the change in species diversity with time, is a spatially explicit phenomenon. Three spatial factors clearly affect diversity: (1) the structure and heterogeneity of the landscape that limits species immigration and ultimate community size; (2) neighborhood interactions that determine colonization and extinction rates and influence residence times of local populations; and (3) disturbances that open spatially contiguous areas for recolonization by less abundant species. The importance of these three factors was first reviewed and then examined with a spatially explicit, multi-species model of plant dispersal, competition and establishment, with an assumption of neutrality (all species had equivalent life histories) that reduced the initial dimensionality of the problem. The simulations assumed that the probability of immigration was a linear function of mainland abundance and distance to islands, similar to the equilibrium theory of island biogeography and the unified neutral theory of biodiversity. The rate of increase in species richness was not constant across island sizes, declining as island area became very large. This pattern was explained by the spatial dynamics of colonization and establishment, a non-random process that cannot be explained by passive sampling alone. Simulations showed that population establishment depended critically on rare long-distance dispersal events while population persistence was achieved by the formation of aggregated species distributions that developed through restricted dispersal and local competitive interactions. Nevertheless, species richness always declined to a single species in the absence of disturbances, while up to 40 species could persist to 10,000 years when spatially dependent mortality was added. Further explorations with spatially explicit models will be required to fully appreciate the consequence of land use change and altered disturbance regimes on patterns of species distribution and the maintenance of diversity.},

abstract = {The first step in understanding ecological processes is to identify patterns. Ecological data are usually characterized by spatial structures due to spatial autocorrelation. Spatial autocorrelation refers to the pattern in which observations from nearby locations are more likely to have similar magnitude than by chance alone. The magnitude, intensity, as well as extent of spatial autocorrelation can be quantified using spatial statistics. Most ecological data exhibit some degree of spatial autocorrelation, depending on the scale at which the data were recorded and then analyzed. Ecological phenomena are also characterized by the multiple ecological processes that act upon them; these processes often operate at more than one spatial scale. Ecological data are a composite of several spatial scales: trends at macroscales; patches, gradients and patterns at meso- and local scales; and random patterns at local and microscales. The different processes and patterns at different scales are not necessarily linear or additive, and this contributes to the degree of spatial dependence in the data.},

abstract = {Aim This paper reviews possible candidate models that may be used in theoretical modelling and empirical studies of speciesâarea relationships (SARs). The SAR is an important and well-proven tool in ecology. The power and the exponential functions are by far the models that are best known and most frequently applied to speciesâarea data, but they might not be the most appropriate. Recent work indicates that the shape of speciesâarea curves in arithmetic space is often not convex but sigmoid and also has an upper asymptote.Methods Characteristics of six convex and eight sigmoid models are discussed and interpretations of different parameters summarized. The convex models include the power, exponential, Monod, negative exponential, asymptotic regression and rational functions, and the sigmoid models include the logistic, Gompertz, extreme value, MorganâMercerâFlodin, Hill, MichaelisâMenten, Lomolino and ChapmanâRichards functions plus the cumulative Weibull and beta-P distributions.Conclusions There are two main types of speciesâarea curves: sample curves that are inherently convex and isolate curves, which are sigmoid. Both types may have an upper asymptote. A few have attempted to fit convex asymptotic and/or sigmoid models to speciesâarea data instead of the power or exponential models. Some of these or other models reviewed in this paper should be useful, especially if speciesâarea models are to be based more on biological processes and patterns in nature than mere curve fitting. The negative exponential function is an example of a convex model and the cumulative Weibull distribution an example of a sigmoid model that should prove useful. A location parameter may be added to these two and some of the other models to simulate absolute minimum area requirements.},

@article{Li2005,
abstract = {There is a large, popular, and growing literature on "scale-free" networks with the Internet along with metabolic networks representing perhaps the canonical examples. While this has in many ways reinvigorated graph theory, there is unfortunately no consistent, precise definition of scale-free graphs and few rigorous proofs of many of their claimed properties. In fact, it is easily shown that the existing theory has many inherent contradictions and that the most celebrated claims regarding the Internet and biology are verifiably false. In this paper, we introduce a structural metric that allows us to differentiate between all simple, connected graphs having an identical degree sequence, which is of particular interest when that sequence satisfies a power law relationship. We demonstrate that the proposed structural metric yields considerable insight into the claimed properties of SF graphs and provides one possible measure of the extent to which a graph is scale-free. This structural view can be related to previously studied graph properties such as the various notions of self-similarity, likelihood, betweenness and assortativity. Our approach clarifies much of the confusion surrounding the sensational qualitative claims in the current literature, and offers a rigorous and quantitative alternative, while suggesting the potential for a rich and interesting theory. This paper is aimed at readers familiar with the basics of Internet technology and comfortable with a theorem-proof style of exposition, but who may be unfamiliar with the existing literature on scale-free networks.},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that biodiversity decreases the spatial variability of biomass production between subplots taken within experimental grassland plots. Our findings supported this hypothesis if functional diversity (weighted Raoâs Q) was considered. Further analyses revealed that diversity in rooting depth and clonal growth form were the most important components of functional diversity stabilizing productivity. Using species or functional group richness as diversity measures there was no significant effect on spatial variability of biomass production, demonstrating the importance of the biodiversity component considered. Moreover, we found a significant increase in spatial variability of productivity with decreasing size of harvested area, suggesting small-scale heterogeneity as an important driver. The ability of diverse communities to stabilize biomass production across spatial heterogeneity may be due to complementary use of spatial niches. Nevertheless, the positive effect of functional diversity on spatial stability appears to be less pronounced than previously reported effects on temporal stability.},

However, we show here that those two properties may be quantified by a single dimension only in some specific cases. In general, a non-integer D HB quantifies only the roughness, and self-similarity needs to be evidenced or postulated by other means. Second, we revisit some aspects of the practical estimation of D HB. We recommend the use of madogram instead of variogram for estimations based on geostatistics. We propose a simplification of its estimation for 2D fields and discuss its possible relationship with self-similarity. We finally underline the problem of scale and resolution. Field data recorded during a scientific acoustic survey on the North Sea herring are used for illustrations.

abstract = {L\'{e}vy walks (\{LW)\} are superdiffusive and scale-free random walks that have recently emerged as a new conceptual tool for modeling animal search paths. They have been claimed to be more efficient than the "classical" random walks, and they also seem able to account for the actual search patterns of various species. This suggests that many animals may move using a \{LW\} process. \{LW\} patterns look like the actual search patterns displayed by animals foraging in a patchy environment, where extensive and intensive searching modes alternate, and which can be generated by a mixture of classical random walks. In this context, even elementary composite Brownian walks are more efficient than \{LW\} but may be confounded with them because they present apparent move-length-heavy tail distributions and superdiffusivity. The move-length "survival" distribution (i.e., the cumulative number of moves greater than any given threshold) appears to be a better means to highlight a \{LW\} pattern. Even once such a pattern has been clearly identified, it remains to determine how it was actually generated, because a \{LW\} pattern is not necessarily produced by a \{LW\} process but may emerge from the way the animal interacted with the environment structure through more classical movement processes. In any case, emergent movement patterns should not be confused with the processes that gave rise to them.},

abstract = {Size frequency distributions of canopy gaps are a hallmark of forest dynamics. But it remains unknown whether legacies of forest disturbance are influencing vertical size structure of landscapes, or space-filling in the canopy volume. We used data from LiDAR remote sensing to quantify distributions of canopy height and sizes of 434 501 canopy gaps in five tropical rain forest landscapes in Costa Rica and Hawaii. The sites represented a wide range of variation in structure and natural disturbance history, from canopy gap dynamics in lowland Costa Rica and Hawaii, to stages and types of stand-level dieback on upland Mauna Kea and Kohala volcanoes. Large differences in vertical canopy structure characterized these five tropical rain forest landscapes, some of which were related to known disturbance events. Although there were quantitative differences in the values of scaling exponents within and among sites, size frequency distributions of canopy gaps followed power laws at all sites and in all canopy height classes. Scaling relationships in gap size at different heights in the canopy were qualitatively similar at all sites, revealing a remarkable similarity despite clearly defined differences in species composition and modes of prevailing disturbance. These findings indicate that power-law gap-size frequency distributions are ubiquitous features of these five tropical rain forest landscapes, and suggest that mechanisms of forest disturbance may be secondary to other processes in determining vertical and horizontal size structure in canopies.},

abstract = {1) We estimated the dry, living, above-ground biomass (AGB) standing stock and its turnover in a 50-hectare forest plot located in moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The estimates were obtained using inventory data collected every 5 years from 1985 to 2000, including measurements of all trees 1 cm diameter. 2) Four different allometric regressions relating trunk diameter and height with AGB were compared. Based on the most consistent method, we estimated that the Barro Colorado forest holds 281 Â± 20 Mg ha1 (1 Mg = 103 kg) of AGB, lianas included. A third of the AGB is stored in trees larger than 70 cm in diameter. 3) Stand-level AGB increment (growth plus recruitment) was highest in the period 1985-90 (7.05 Â± 0.32 Mg ha1 year1, mean Â± 95\% confidence limits based on samples of multiple hectares) and smallest in the period 1990-95 (5.25 Â± 0.26 Mg ha1 year1), while AGB losses were similar during the three intervals (mean 5.43 Â± 0.72 Mg ha1 year1). This resulted in significant differences in AGB change (defined as increment minus loss) among census intervals; including branchfalls, the AGB of Barro Colorado Island increased in 1985-90 (+0.82 Â± 0.84 Mg ha1 year1), decreased in 1990-95 (0.69 Â± 0.82 Mg ha1 year1), and increased again in 1995-2000 (+0.45 Â± 0.70 Mg ha1 year1). The 15-year average was +0.20 Mg ha1 year1, but with a confidence interval that spanned zero (0.68 to 0.63 Mg ha1 year1). 4) Branch falls and partial breakage of stems had a significant influence on the AGB changes. They contributed an average of 0.46 Mg ha1 year1 to the AGB loss. About 5\% of AGB increment was due to trees less than 10 cm in diameter. 5) To test whether the AGB of tropical forests is increasing due to climate change, we propose that in each forest type, at least 10 hectares of forest be inventoried, and that measurements of the small classes (< 10 cm diameter) as well as large size classes be included. Biomass loss due to crown damage should also be estimated.},

abstract = {\{BackgroundThe\} quantification of species-richness and species-turnover is essential to effective monitoring of ecosystems. Wetland ecosystems are particularly in need of such monitoring due to their sensitivity to rainfall, water management and other external factors that affect hydrology, soil, and species patterns. A key challenge for environmental scientists is determining the linkage between natural and human stressors, and the effect of that linkage at the species level in space and time. We propose pixel intensity based Shannon entropy for estimating species-richness, and introduce a method based on statistical wavelet multiresolution texture analysis to quantitatively assess interseasonal and interannual species \{turnover.Methodology/Principal\} \{FindingsWe\} model satellite images of regions of interest as textures. We define a texture in an image as a spatial domain where the variations in pixel intensity across the image are both stochastic and multiscale. To compare two textures quantitatively, we first obtain a multiresolution wavelet decomposition of each. Either an appropriate probability density function (pdf) model for the coefficients at each subband is selected, and its parameters estimated, or, a non-parametric approach using histograms is adopted. We choose the former, where the wavelet coefficients of the multiresolution decomposition at each subband are modeled as samples from the generalized Gaussian pdf. We then obtain the joint pdf for the coefficients for all subbands, assuming independence across subbands; an approximation that simplifies the computational burden significantly without sacrificing the ability to statistically distinguish textures. We measure the difference between two textures' representative pdf's via the Kullback-Leibler divergence \{(KL).\} Species turnover, or diversity, is estimated using both this \{KL\} divergence and the difference in Shannon entropy. Additionally, we predict species richness, or diversity, based on the Shannon entropy of pixel \{intensity.To\} test our approach, we specifically use the green band of Landsat images for a water conservation area in the Florida Everglades. We validate our predictions against data of species occurrences for a twenty-eight years long period for both wet and dry seasons. Our method correctly predicts 73\% of species richness. For species turnover, the newly proposed \{KL\} divergence prediction performance is near 100\% accurate. This represents a significant improvement over the more conventional Shannon entropy difference, which provides 85\% accuracy. Furthermore, we find that changes in soil and water patterns, as measured by fluctuations of the Shannon entropy for the red and blue bands respectively, are positively correlated with changes in vegetation. The fluctuations are smaller in the wet season when compared to the dry \{season.Conclusions/SignificanceTexture-based\} statistical multiresolution image analysis is a promising method for quantifying interseasonal differences and, consequently, the degree to which vegetation, soil, and water patterns vary. The proposed automated method for quantifying species richness and turnover can also provide analysis at higher spatial and temporal resolution than is currently obtainable from expensive monitoring campaigns, thus enabling more prompt, more cost effective inference and decision making support regarding anomalous variations in biodiversity. Additionally, a matrix-based visualization of the statistical multiresolution analysis is presented to facilitate both insight and quick recognition of anomalous data.},

abstract = {The scale-dependent species abundance distribution (\{SAD)\} is fundamental in ecology, but few spatially explicit models of this pattern have thus far been studied. Here we show spatially explicit neutral model predictions for \{SADs\} over a wide range of spatial scales, which appear to match empirical patterns qualitatively. We find that the assumption of a log-series \{SAD\} in the metacommunity made by spatially implicit neutral models can be justified with a spatially explicit model in the large area limit. Furthermore, our model predicts that \{SADs\} on multiple scales are characterized by a single, compound parameter that represents the ratio of the survey area to the speciesâ average biogeographic range (which is in turn set by the speciation rate and the dispersal distance). This intriguing prediction is in line with recent empirical evidence for a universal scaling of the species-area curve. Hence we hypothesize that empirical \{SAD\} patterns will show a similar universal scaling for many different taxa and across multiple spatial scales.},

abstract = {Autocorrelation is a very general statistical property of ecological variables observed across geographic space; its most common forms are patches and gradients. Spatial autocorrelation, which comes either from the physical forcing of environmental variables or from community processes, presents a problem for statistical testing because autocorrelated data violate the assumption of independence of most standard statistical procedures. The paper discusses first how autocorrelation in ecological variables can be described and measured, with emphasis on mapping techniques. Then, proper statistical testing in the presence of autocorrelation is briefly discussed. Finally, ways are presented of explicitly introducing spatial structures into ecological models. Two approaches are proposed; in the raw-data approach, the spatial structure takes the form of a polynomial of the x and y geographic coordinates of the sampling stations; in the matrix approach, the spatial structure is introduced in the form of a geographic distance matrix among locations. These two approaches are compared in the concluding section. A table provides a list of computer programs available for spatial analysis.},

abstract = {Species abundance distributions \{(SADs)\} have played a historical role in the development of community ecology. They summarize information about the number and the relative abundance of the species encountered in a sample from a given community. For years ecologists have developed theory to characterize species abundance patterns, and the study of these patterns has received special attention in recent years. In particular, ecologists have developed statistical sampling theories to predict the \{SAD\} expected in a sample taken from a region. Here, we emphasize an important limitation of all current sampling theories: they ignore species identity. We present an alternative formulation of statistical sampling theory that incorporates species asymmetries in sampling and dynamics, and relate, in a general way, the community-level \{SAD\} to the distribution of population abundances of the species integrating the community. We illustrate the theory on a stochastic community model that can accommodate species asymmetry. Finally, we discuss the potentially important role of species asymmetries in shaping recently observed multi-humped \{SADs\} and in comparisons of the relative success of niche and neutral theories at predicting \{SADs.\}},

abstract = {Plant species create aggregations of conspecifics as a consequence of limited seed dispersal, clonal growth and heterogeneous environment. Such intraspecific aggregation increases the importance of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition which may slow down competitive exclusion and promote species coexistence. To examine how spatial aggregation impacts the functioning of experimental assemblages of varying species richness, eight perennial grassland species of different growth form were grown in random and aggregated patterns in monocultures, two-, four-, and eight-species mixtures. In mixtures with an aggregated pattern, monospecific clumps were interspecifically segregated. Mixed model \{ANOVA\} was used to test (i) how the total productivity and productivity of individual species is affected by the number of species in a mixture, and (ii) how these relationships are affected by spatial pattern of sown plants. The main patterns of productivity response to species richness conform to other studies: non-transgressive overyielding is omnipresent (the productivity of mixtures is higher than the average of its constituent species so that the net diversity, selection and complementarity effects are positive), whereas transgressive overyielding is found only in a minority of cases (average of log(overyielding) being close to zero or negative). The theoretical prediction that plants in a random pattern should produce more than in an aggregated pattern (the distances to neighbours are smaller and consequently the competition among neighbours stronger) was confirmed in monocultures of all the eight species. The situation is more complicated in mixtures, probably as a consequence of complicated interplay between interspecific and intraspecific competition. The most productive species (Achillea, Holcus, Plantago) were competitively superior and increased their relative productivity with mixture richness. The intraspecific competition of these species is stronger than that of most other species. The aggregated pattern in the full mixture increased the survival of subordinate species, and consequently, we conclude that an aggregated pattern can promote species coexistence (or at least postpone competitive exclusion), particularly in comparison with homogeneously sown mixtures.},

abstract = {Summary Biodiversity is an important topic of ecological research. A common form of data collected to investigate patterns of biodiversity is the number of individuals of each species at a series of locations. These data contain information on the number of individuals (abundance), the number of species (richness), and the relative proportion of each species within the sampled assemblage (evenness). If there are enough sampled locations across an environmental gradient then the data should contain information on how these three attributes of biodiversity change over gradients. We show that the rank abundance distribution (\{RAD)\} representation of the data provides a convenient method for quantifying these three attributes constituting biodiversity. We present a statistical framework for modeling \{RADs\} and allow their multivariate distribution to vary according to environmental gradients. The method relies on three models: a negative binomial model, a truncated negative binomial model, and a novel model based on a modified Dirichlet-multinomial that allows for a particular type of heterogeneity observed in \{RAD\} data. The method is motivated by, and applied to, a large-scale marine survey off the coast of Western Australia, Australia. It provides a rich description of biodiversity and how it changes with environmental conditions.},

abstract = {We analyzed the relationship between biodiversity and spatial biomass heterogeneity along an ecological succession developed in the laboratory. Periphyton (attached microalgae) biomass spatial patterns at several successional stages were obtained using digital image analysis and at the same time we estimated the species composition and abundance. We show that the spatial pattern was self-similar and as the community developed in an homogeneous environment the pattern is self-organized. To characterize it we estimated the multifractal spectrum of generalized dimensions Dq. Using Dq we analyze the existence of cycles of heterogeneity during succession and the use of the information dimension D1 as an index of successional stage. We did not find cycles but the values of D1 showed an increasing trend as the succession developed and the biomass was higher. D1 was also negatively correlated with Shannon's diversity. Several studies have found this relationship in different ecosystems but here we prove that the community self-organizes and generates its own spatial heterogeneity influencing diversity. If this is confirmed with more experimental and theoretical evidence D1 could be used as an index, easily calculated from remote sensing data, to detect high or low diversity areas.},

Recently, Harte et al. argued that the slope of the SAR for a given area is driven by a single parameter, the ratio between total number of individuals and number of species (i.e., the mean population size across species at a given scale). We provide a geometric interpretation of this dependence. At the same time, however, we show that this dependence cannot be universal across taxa: if it holds for a taxon composed from two subsets of species and also for one of its subsets, it cannot simultaneously hold for the other subset. Using three data sets, we show that the slope of the SAR considerably varies around the prediction. We estimate the limits of this variation by using geometric considerations, providing a theory based on species spatial turnover at different scales. We argue that the SAR cannot be strictly universal, but its slope at each particular scale varies within the constraints given by speciesâ spatial turnover at finer spatial scales, and this variation is biologically informative.},

Monitoring the dynamics of clusters, we show that the effect of local heterogeneities (e.g., microtopography) is weak, making a spatially homogenous model plausible. We then compare the cluster statistics of the three most frequent species with the patterns obtained from neutral dynamics, examining two families of recruitment kernels: one that interpolates between a limited distance and panmictic dispersal (local-global) and one that assumes a scale-free Cauchy kernel. The results rule out the local-global dispersal model and show that the spatial patterns fit very nicely those obtained from the fat-tailed kernel. Our work emphasizes the importance of spatiotemporal cluster dynamics as an instrument for detecting the factors that govern community assembly.},
