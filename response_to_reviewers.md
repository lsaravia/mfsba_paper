# Individual response:

## Yuxin Zhang 

I appreciate Dr. Zhang's comments on the manuscript. As the software was developed and tested under Linux it should not be expected to work flawlessly under windows. I agree that I would be a great benefit to release at least a windows working version, I will try to update the software as time and resources are available. But I think that the software should be evaluated as is, and not judged because it's available or not under different operative systems. It will be useful to open issues on github to track the development of the software <https://github.com/lsaravia/mfsba/issues>.

The q's can be real numbers or integers in any range and are specified in the **qFile** as explained on the main text.

I think the introduction would benefit greatly from clear examples of the benefits and uses of mfSBA. It seems that the author should address both the benefits of multifractal analysis as well as where the SRS improves upon comparisons made by SAD's. It seems that the author has already made some publications that could address this, and it would be useful to have a brief explanation. 

In general I found the Introduction lacking specificity. For instance the author states in the first paragraph: "If they do apply, they reflect constraints in their organization that can provide clues about the underlying mechanism" What constraints? What underlying mechanism is the author referring to? How does it provide clues about this these mechanisms?

I thank the reviewers for their comments. 


In addition to our responses to reviewers at the bottom, a detailed listing of reviewer comments and our discussion about them can be found here: https://github.com/ropensci/taxize_/issues/178. The following is a summary of the changes made in response to reviewer's comments:

We have improved language where pointed out by reviews: removed sentences, changed awkward language, and corrected spelling and grammar mistakes. 
* In response to comments by two of the three reviewer's we have added a third appendix that goes over using API keys and how to install the development version of the software.
* There were a number of suggestions about changing the software itself (improving naming of functions and outputs). We agree with these suggestions, and although the changes to the software have not been made yet, we plan on making the changes in the next version of the software and we will then update the manuscript accordingly.
