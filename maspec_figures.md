\caption{$D_q$ multifractal spectrum calculated from species spatial distributions. If each species is assigned a number at random (unordered) the $D_q$ is almost flat corresponding to a uniform plus random noise distribution. When the species rank surface (SRS) is used each especies is assigned to it's rank the $D_q$ spectrum have a wide range of values. The error bars are the standard deviation obtained from the linear regressions used to estimate $D_q$.}
