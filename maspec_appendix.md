\caption{Comparison of a multiespecies spatial distribution generated by a neutral model with 64 possible species. Both figures represent the same species distribution but with diferent numeric values assigned to species. (a) The values are assigned by the simulation program. The most abundant species have higher values and the range 1-64 represent all posible species. (b) Spatial Rank Surface: each species is assigned to its rank as explained in the main text: the most abundant species has the lowest value and represent valleys, rare species represent peaks.The range is lower because some species did not appear.}
